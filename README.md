# Street View Geolocation Predictor

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras to predict **latitude and longitude** from **street-level panoramic images**. The images are preprocessed and fed into the CNN for a regression task.

## Files Included

### `train.py`
- Main training script.
- Loads, preprocesses, and splits the data.
- Defines the CNN architecture and compiles the model.
- Loads pre-trained weights.
- Trains the model and evaluates performance.

### `preprocess.py`
- Preprocesses raw images from the `imgs/` directory.
- Combines four separate street-view images into one long panoramic image.
- Outputs results to `preprocessed_imgs/`.

### `evalute.py`
- Evaluates the trained model on a test set.
- Can also run a prediction on a single example.

### `collectImgs.py`
- Uses Selenium and PyAutoGUI to automate image collection from an online map service.
- Saves both images and associated latitude/longitude data.

### Additional Files/Directories
- **`latLong.csv`** – Contains latitude/longitude pairs for each preprocessed image.
- **`preprocessed_imgs/`** – Contains `200 × 2000` grayscale panoramic images.
- **`imgs/`** – Raw captured street-view image segments.
- **`checkpoints/`** – Model weight files (`.ckpt`) saved during training.

## ⚙️ CNN Architecture

The model is a deep CNN designed to extract visual features from wide panoramic input images and output a pair: [longitude, latitude]


### **Input Shape**
(200, 2000, 1) # Height × Width × Channels (grayscale)

## ▶️ Getting Started

### **1. Data Collection (Optional)**
Run the automated scraper:

```bash
python collectImgs.py
```

2. Preprocessing
```bash
python preprocess.py
```
Creates combined panoramic images in preprocessed_imgs/.

3. Training
```bash
python train.py
```

Loads/continues from checkpoint cp-00030.ckpt.

Trains for 100 epochs.

Saves new checkpoints every 5 steps.

4. Evaluation
```bash
python evalute.py
```
Tests performance and runs sample predictions.
